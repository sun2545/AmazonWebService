1.1 What is cloud computing? 

The level of abstraction offered by the cloud varies, from offering virtual machines (VMs) to providing software as a service (SaasS)
based on complex distributed systems.

AWS is a public cloud. Cloud computing services also have several classifications:
 Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)—Offers fundamental resources like computing, storage, and networking capabilities, using virtual        machines such as Amazon EC2, Google Compute Engine, and Microsoft Azure.
 Platform as a service (PaaS)—Provides platforms to deploy custom applications to the cloud, such as AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Google App      Engine, and Heroku.
 Software as a service (SaaS)—Combines infrastructure and software running in the cloud, including office applications like Amazon          WorkSpaces, Google Apps for Work, and Microsoft Office 365.
